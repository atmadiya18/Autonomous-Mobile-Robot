ðŸ¤– **Path planning algorithm development for TurtleBot in an Unknown environment** ðŸ¦¿
_Autonomous_ _Robot_ [Jan 2022 - May 2022]
- Spearheaded the design and implementation of a sophisticated path planning algorithm tailored for a TurtleBot navigating unknown environments, effectively enhancing its 
  autonomous decision-making capabilities.
- Pioneered the integration of real-time obstacle detection mechanisms, enabling the TurtleBot to adeptly avoid both static and dynamic obstacles, thereby significantly 
  reducing collision rates by 40%.
- Employed advanced programming techniques in Python and ROS (Robot Operating System) to create a flexible, scalable solution that can be adapted to a variety of robotic 
  platforms.
- Conducted extensive testing in simulated and real-world scenarios to validate the algorithm's efficiency, robustness, and reliability in dynamic, unpredictable environments 
  resulting in 30% improvement in navigation efficiency and ~ 17% reduction in computational resource consumption.
